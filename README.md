# Weather Dashboard Challenge

# Scope of Project:
    Create a weather dashboard using an API in order to pull a five-day forecast alongside humidity, UVindex, and wind speed.

# Technology Used
    I utilized Javascript, HTML, Moment.js, and Bootstrap. The majority of the project was made in JS, with bootstrap heavily utilized as well, and moment included to format the "Current date" properly. 

# User Story
    When a user opens the page,
    They are shown a search bar.
    After prompting a user to search via city,
    The User is met with a 5 day card container
    Which shows the user temp, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
